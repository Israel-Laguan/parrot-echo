> I assume you are using Linux or Mac, but it's similar in Windows. At the end there is a [FAQ](#troubleshooting) if you ran into known issues.

First of all you have to clone the code using git (also you can just [download the code][]).

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/Israel-Laguan/parrot-echo.git
> cd parrot-echo/server
```

## Pre Requisites

- [ ] `npm` v8.0 +
- [ ] `node` v12.18 +
- [ ] A good terminal
- [ ] A Text Editor like VSCode
- [ ] A browser like Firefox or Chrome, or a client like Postman/Insomnia for testing

### Short Version

```sh
> yarn install
# or
> npm i
```

Now you should have all the folders and files to run the server, and be ready for action!

- `npm run dev` to start the local server

- Enter [localhost:8000][] in a browser to see the Swagger documentation for the server.
